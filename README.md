# ETF-Price-Analysis
# Data Science Project

# Description:

1. Data Collection: The project involved analyzing the prices of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). To obtain the required data, the project utilized data from Kaggle. Kaggle is a popular platform for accessing and sharing datasets. The project collected the necessary dataset from Kaggle to proceed with the analysis.

2. Data Import: Once the dataset was obtained from Kaggle, it was imported into the project environment. Python, being a versatile programming language for data analysis, was used for this purpose.

3. Data Cleaning: Before proceeding with the analysis, it's crucial to ensure that the data is clean and structured properly. The project utilized Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library in Python, to clean the dataset. Using Pandas DataFrames, the project performed data cleaning tasks such as removing missing values, handling outliers, and ensuring consistent data formats.

4. Data Visualization: To gain insights from the dataset and effectively communicate the findings, the project employed visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. These libraries provide various tools for creating visual representations of the data, such as line plots, bar charts, and scatter plots. By visualizing the data, the project aimed to identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the ETF price data.

5. Machine Learning Algorithms: In order to assess the data and potentially make predictions, the project utilized machine learning algorithms. Specifically, the project employed the Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting Regressor algorithms. These algorithms are commonly used in regression tasks to predict numerical values. By applying these algorithms to the ETF price data, the project aimed to gain insights and potentially forecast future prices.

Overall, this project involved collecting ETF price data, importing it into Python, cleaning the data using Pandas, visualizing the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn, and applying machine learning algorithms to assess the data and potentially make predictions. The use of Python, Pandas, and various visualization libraries allowed for efficient data analysis and interpretation.
